					<h5>Active:</h5> 
					30 min
					<h5>Yield: </h5>
					2 servings
					<p>Get our one sheet pan, put all of the veggies and chickpeas on the pan and make some quinoa and cut some avocado slices to finish off the dish.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>You can forgo the spice on the chickpeas if you are sensitive to spices like curry powder. </li>

						<li>Substitutions can be made to use rice instead of quinoa, and guacamole for avocado slices. </li>

						<li>To make this dish dairy free: please forgo the Greek yogurt and tahini. </li>
					</ul>
				
					<h4>Ingredients</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>One 14-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
						<li>3/4 teaspoon spicy curry powder</li>
						<li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
						<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
						<li>1 small red onion (about 4 ounces), cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
						<li>1 small sweet potato (about 7 ounces), peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
						<li>4 ounces medium cremini mushrooms, halved</li>
						<li>1/3 cup fat-free Greek yogurt</li>
						<li>1 tablespoon tahini </li>
						<li>1 lemon</li>
						<li>1 cup cooked quinoa</li>
						<li>1/2 avocado, thinly sliced </li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Directions</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Toss the chickpeas with the curry powder, 1 teaspoon of the oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl. Place on one side of a baking sheet. </li>

						<li>Arrange the onions next to the chickpeas, then the sweet potatoes and lastly the mushrooms.</li>

						<li>Toss the onions, sweet potatoes and mushrooms with the remaining 3 teaspoons oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of black pepper. </li>

						<li>Bake until the chickpeas are a bit crunchy and the sweet potatoes are softened and starting to turn brown in a few spots, 25 to 30 minutes. </li>

						<li>Meanwhile, whisk the yogurt, tahini and juice of half the lemon in a small bowl. Slice the remaining lemon into wedges. </li>

						<li>Divide the quinoa between two bowls. Arrange half the vegetables and avocado slices on top of the quinoa, leaving a space for the yogurt in the middle. Dollop the yogurt in the empty space and serve with the lemon wedges.</li>

				<h2>St. Patricks Day Vegan Pesto Pasta</h2>
				<p><strong>St. Patricks Day & Sunday = Pasta</strong> <br>St. Patricks Day is a very normal day to see people with green socks and eating Lucky Charms. But, what if you want to put a green spin on your Sunday pasta meal? Well, the perfect place to start is by adding herbs, and for pasta having a go to pesto sauce is the answer to any time you are tired of the plain, boring red sauce. 

				<p>Normally, pesto contains dairy ingredients, but with this amazing recipe courtesy of Samah of Dadaeats, your Sunday and St. Patricks Day will be one for the books.<p>

				<p>View the Recipe below</p>

				<h4>Ingredients</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>1 box pasta of choice</li>
					<li>3/4 bag of spinach</li>
					<li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
					<li>4 TBSP extra-virgin olive oil</li>
					<li>1/4 cup of water</li>
					<li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
					<li>Small handful basil leaves or basil flakes to taste</li>
					<li>Chili flakes to taste</li>
					<li>Oregano to taste</li>
					<li>Salt to taste</li>
					<li>Pepper to taste</li>
				</ul>
					
				<h4>Instructions</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Boil a full box of your pasta of choice and prep the pesto while that's cooking. For the pesto, throw all of your ingredients into a food processor/blender and pulse until mixed. Add seasonings to taste as you wish. I always add more chili flakes because I like it spicy! When the pasta is boiled, drain and add all of the sauce to the pot. Mix thoroughly. I like to blanch grape tomatoes in chili infused olive oil to add some color and sweetness to the dish. Feel free to add your toppings of choice - I'd suggest some almond milk ricotta if you're into that, nutritional yeast is great, or even some pine nuts. This is great served hot or as a cold pasta salad! </li>

				<h2>St. Patricks Day Vegan Pesto Pasta</h2>
				<p><strong>St. Patricks Day & Sunday = Pasta</strong> St. Patricks Day is a very normal day to see people with green socks and eating Lucky Charms. But, what if you want to put a green spin on your Sunday pasta meal? Well, the perfect place to start is by adding herbs, and for pasta having a go to pesto sauce is the answer to any time you are tired of the plain, boring red sauce. 

				<p>Normally, pesto contains dairy ingredients, but with this amazing recipe courtesy of Samah of Dadaeats, your Sunday and St. Patricks Day will be one for the books.<p>

				<h4>Ingredients</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>1 box pasta of choice</li>
					<li>3/4 bag of spinach</li>
					<li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
					<li>4 TBSP extra-virgin olive oil</li>
					<li>1/4 cup of water</li>
					<li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
					<li>Small handful basil leaves or basil flakes to taste</li>
					<li>Chili flakes to taste</li>
					<li>Oregano to taste</li>
					<li>Salt to taste</li>
					<li>Pepper to taste</li>
				</ul>
					
				<h4>Instructions</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Boil a full box of your pasta of choice and prep the pesto while that's cooking. For the pesto, throw all of your ingredients into a food processor/blender and pulse until mixed. Add seasonings to taste as you wish. I always add more chili flakes because I like it spicy! When the pasta is boiled, drain and add all of the sauce to the pot. Mix thoroughly. I like to blanch grape tomatoes in chili infused olive oil to add some color and sweetness to the dish. Feel free to add your toppings of choice - I'd suggest some almond milk ricotta if you're into that, nutritional yeast is great, or even some pine nuts. This is great served hot or as a cold pasta salad! </li>

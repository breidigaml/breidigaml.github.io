			<h3 class="blogs">Fridays for Lent: Roasted Veggie Bowl</h3>
			<p>Recipe courtesy of the <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/roasted-veggie-buddha-bowl-5293785">Food Network</a></p>
			<h5>Active:</h5> 
			30 min
			<h5>Yield: </h5>
			2 servings


			<p>Get out one sheet pan, put all of the veggies and chickpeas on to the pan to bake. In the mean time make some quinoa and cut some avocado slices to finish off the dish.</p>

			<h3>My Recommendations:</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Don't Like Spice? Forgo adding the curry powderspice onto the chickpeas. Instead I recommend using chili powder, not as spicy but still gives the dish some flavor. </li>

					<li>Can't Find Quinoa? Substitute the quinoa with rice.</li>

					<li>Supermarket Shortcut: Buy Premade Guacamole as a time saver.</li>

					<li>To make dairy free: Do not use Greek yogurt. Instead I suggest just picking up some Hummus and having that on the side.</li>
				</ul>

			<h4>Ingredients</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>One 14-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
					<li>3/4 teaspoon spicy curry powder</li>
					<li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
					<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
					<li>1 small red onion (about 4 ounces), cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
					<li>1 small sweet potato (about 7 ounces), peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
					<li>4 ounces medium cremini mushrooms, halved</li>
					<li>1/3 cup fat-free Greek yogurt</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon tahini </li>
					<li>1 lemon</li>
					<li>1 cup cooked quinoa</li>
					<li>1/2 avocado, thinly sliced </li>
				</ul>

			<h4>Directions</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Toss the chickpeas with the curry powder, 1 teaspoon of the oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl. Place on one side of a baking sheet. </li>

					<li>Arrange the onions next to the chickpeas, then the sweet potatoes and lastly the mushrooms.</li>

					<li>Toss the onions, sweet potatoes and mushrooms with the remaining 3 teaspoons oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of black pepper. </li>

					<li>Bake until the chickpeas are a bit crunchy and the sweet potatoes are softened and starting to turn brown in a few spots, 25 to 30 minutes. </li>

					<li>Meanwhile, whisk the yogurt, tahini and juice of half the lemon in a small bowl. Slice the remaining lemon into wedges. </li>

					<li>Divide the quinoa between two bowls. Arrange half the vegetables and avocado slices on top of the quinoa, leaving a space for the yogurt in the middle. Dollop the yogurt in the empty space and serve with the lemon wedges.</li>

			<h3 class="blogs">St. Patricks Day Vegan Pesto Pasta</h3>
			<p>St. Patricks Day has come and gone but this years St. Patrick's Day was celebrated on a Sunday. Normally, for many families including mine, Sundays mean Pasta! St. Patricks Day normally shows people sporting green socks and eating Lucky Charms. But, there is more than just Corned Beef and Cabbage that you can have on this most famous of Catholic feast days. <br> So how about putting a green spin on your Sunday pasta meal? How should we do that? Well, the perfect place to start is by adding herbs and creating a pesto sauce.</p>
